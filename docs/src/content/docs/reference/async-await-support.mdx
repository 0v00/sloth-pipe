title: Async Await Support
description: sloth-pipe supports asynchronous operations within the pipeline.
---

`sloth-pipe` supports asynchronous operations within the pipeline. Functions passed to `to` or `tap`
can be asynchronous, and `exec` will return a Promise if any function in the pipeline is
asynchronous.

**Async Example**:

```typescript
const asyncResult = await Pipe(5)
    .to(async (x) => x * 2)
    .to(async (x) => x + 3)
    .exec();

console.log(asyncResult); // Outputs: 13
```
