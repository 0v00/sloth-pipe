title: Pipe Function
description: Overview of the Pipe function.

The Pipe function is the cornerstone of the Sloth Pipe library. It serves as the entry point for
creating a new pipe, setting the stage for a series of transformations or operations to be performed
on an initial value. By accepting an initial value as its parameter, it instantiates a Pipeable
object. This object then becomes the conduit through which data flows and transforms, leveraging the
library's functional programming capabilities.

### Pipe\<T>(initialValue: T): Pipeable\<T>

Creates a new pipe with an initial value.

**Parameters**:

-   `initialValue`: The starting value for the pipe.

**Returns**: A `Pipeable` object representing the pipe.

**Example**:

```typescript
const pipe = Pipe(10);
```
