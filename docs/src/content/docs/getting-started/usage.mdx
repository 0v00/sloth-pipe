Sloth Pipe is a functional library designed to streamline the process of applying a sequence of
transformations to a value in TypeScript. It enables chaining multiple operations in a clear and
readable manner.

## Importing the Library

Begin by importing the Pipe function from the sloth-pipe library:

```ts
import { Pipe } from "sloth-pipe";
```

## Initializing the Pipe

Create a new pipe instance by calling Pipe() with the initial value. This value is the starting
point for subsequent transformations:

```ts
const pipeInstance = Pipe(5);
```

## Applying Transformations

Use the .to() method to define transformations. Each .to() takes a function as an argument. This
function describes how the current value should be transformed:

The first transformation multiplies the input by 2:

```ts
.to((x) => x * 2)
```

The second transformation adds 3 to the result of the first transformation:

```ts
.to((x) => x + 3)
```

## Executing the Pipe

Complete the chain of transformations with the .exec() method. This method executes the
transformations in sequence and returns the final result:

```ts
const result = pipeInstance.exec();
```

## Output:

The final result can be used as needed. In this example, it's logged to the console:

```ts
console.log(result); // Outputs: 13
```
