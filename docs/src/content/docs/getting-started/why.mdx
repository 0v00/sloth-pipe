title: Why Sloth Pipe?
description: Why should you use Sloth Pipe?
---

Developers want pipes. They've been one of the
[most requested features](https://2020.stateofjs.com/en-US/opinions/#missing_from_js) in JavaScript
[for years](https://2022.stateofjs.com/en-US/opinions/#top_currently_missing_from_js), and there's
even a [Stage 2 proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pipeline-operator) for adding them to the
language. Sloth Pipe isn't a direct replacement for the proposed pipeline operator, but it does
offer a similar experience and many of the
[same benefits](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pipeline-operator#why-a-pipe-operator).

## Features

Sloth Pipe offers a wide range of features that make it a powerful and flexible tool for working
with:

-   **Lazy Evaluation:** Computations are only performed when necessary, optimizing performance and
    resource utilization.
-   **Chainable API:** Enables the creation of fluent and readable code by chaining multiple
    operations.
-   **Error Handling:** Built-in support for error handling within the pipe.
-   **Async/Await Compatibility:** Seamlessly integrate asynchronous functions into your pipes.
-   **Tap Operations:** Allows side-effects without altering the pipe's main data flow.
-   **Reusable pipes:** Easily reuse pipes, even after execution.
-   **Extensible:** Easily extendable with custom functions and operations.
-   **Type-Safe:** Written in TypeScript, with full support for type inference and type safety.
-   **Lightweight:** Small and lightweight, with no external dependencies.
-   **Well-Tested:** Thoroughly tested with 100% code coverage.
